# cstats

Project library to implement from scratch various statistical tools, for using in C, such as:

* parametric estimation:
  Gaussian mixture models, bayesian parameter updating, estimating pdf...

* Machine learning modelling:
  Model implementations such as decision trees, linear regression and neural networks architectures. It will (hopefully) include an autograd implementation.
